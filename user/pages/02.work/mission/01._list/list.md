        title: Mission
        text: "TJ SGA will advocate for students by proposing policy that improves student experience, working with organizations to provide academic and personal support to students, and organizing innovative events to foster a sense colonial spirit. We want to serve the needs of the student body, and will therefore be transparent and approachable by encouraging the student body to voice their concerns and making SGA documents publicly accessible. Ultimately, we aim to make TJHSST a place where every student has the opportunity and resources to make the most of their four years here.\r\n"
