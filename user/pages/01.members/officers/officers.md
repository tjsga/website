        title: 'Sean Nguyen'
        subtitle: President
        text: 'I’m extremely fortunate to serve as this year''s President and continue the initiatives and projects that were abruptly halted by COVID-19. Having served two years on my class council and a year as the SGA Treasurer, I’ve coordinated school-wide events and policy efforts to bridge the student body and the administration under a common purpose. As the student liaison to the PTSA and the co-chair of the Mental Health Coalition, I seek to maintain this continued dialogue and project our shared voices & views when driving progress on issues like discrimination in underrepresented minority groups, stigmatized mental health reform, and an absence of self-enjoyment in our norms. We are all in a unique position to mold the future of Jefferson, so I implore us to never underestimate the power of resiliency and never be complacent with the status quo. By getting out of our comfort zone, we will be the change-makers, movers, and shakers that challenge the Colonial way-of-life. Don’t hesitate to contact me by email (2021snguyen@tjhsst.edu) or via messenger to break the cycle of living to work more instead of working more to live.'

        title: 'Tiffany Ji'
        subtitle: 'Vice President'
        text: 'It is my honor to serve as the 2020-2021 Vice President. Since freshman year, I have been committed to helping the school through student government. Freshman year, I served as 2021 Class Council Treasurer, raising money through class-wide events, activities, and bake sales. For the past two years, I was lucky to be on the Executive Committee and worked on initiatives such as improving recycling, creating a Mental Wellness Room, and modifying the B Average policy. This year, my main goal is to decrease stigma towards the poignant mental health issues in the student body and improve diversity at our school. I believe the toughest conversations about mental health and race are how we can work towards a better TJ. So, I maintain that student leadership goes beyond working alongside students, and means talking to administration, the school board, and even parents. This school is truly a special place and I am so excited for what we can do this upcoming year. Please feel free to reach out to me at 2021tji@tjhsst.edu.'

        title: 'Bhaswith Suresh'
        subtitle: Treasurer
        text: 'Hey guys! I''m Bhaswith Suresh (class of 2022). Being one of two students to come to TJ from my middle school, I thought that TJ would be a scary experience. However, I was amazed at how many friends I had made in the first week and the number of people who shared my interests. My goal is to continue to foster that culture and expand it to make TJ as tight of a community as possible even in these uncertain times. In freshman year, I was the class treasurer and will use my experience to further our goals as a school. I am a firm believer in the power of teamwork and can’t wait to work with everyone this year! In my free time, I enjoy playing golf, debate, and meeting new people! Please reach out to me on facebook or my email 2022ksuresh@tjhsst.edu to talk about anything or just to say hi."Great things are done by a series of small things brought together" - Vincent Van Goh'

        title: 'Jordan Lee'
        subtitle: Secretary
        text: 'What’s up? My name is Jordan Lee and I’m pleased to serve on as your secretary for this school year! Before working with SGA, I’ve been blessed to be a part of FroshComm and Class Council for my Freshman and Sophomore years. Throughout my time serving the student body, my goal has always been to make TJ an environment where people can wholeheartedly chase their passions and do it as a family. High school can be tough, and the challenge is inevitable. However, I hope that my time at TJ can help to encourage people to keep pushing through, find joy, and make unforgettable memories in the process. With fun events like Homecoming and JDay, we can bring our school together. With more resources for mental health, we can keep students motivated and give them the support they need. With representing the student body, we can make the voices of our students heard. For anyone who wants to hear their voice heard, feel free to email me at 2021jlee@tjhsst.edu or hit me up on Facebook Messenger!'
