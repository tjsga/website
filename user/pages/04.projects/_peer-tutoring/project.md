title: 'TJ Peer Tutoring'
---
TJ Peer tutoring strives to provide peer-to-peer academic support for students in all subject areas. With 7-8 rigorous courses, many of which are at AP and Post-AP level, students often struggle to keep up with the academic rigor and often resort to dishonest behavior or attending their base high school. With the support of SGA, peer tutoring is able to ensure that every student is supported through their academic career at TJ. Tutors receive volunteer service hours and gain valuable experience mentoring and teaching their peers.
