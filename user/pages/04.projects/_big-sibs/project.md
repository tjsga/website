title: 'Big Sibs'
---
Big Sibs pairs rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors with incoming freshman as mentors and mentees. The goal of the program is to alleviate any fears rising freshmen may have as they enter the TJ community by providing a mentor who has gone through the same experience. By ensuring that every student has someone to talk to who can answer their questions and provide emotional and academic support, Big Sibs hopes to move toward a stress and worry-free TJ environment.
