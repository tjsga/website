As an SGA-run platform for school-wide mental health discussion, the TJ Mental Health Coalition seeks to foster open communication between students, parents, teachers, and administrators at monthly forums. By sponsoring collaborative mental wellness initiatives, promoting parent and teacher involvement in mental health conversations, reforming mental health policies, and providing mental health training, the committeeâ€™s goal is to create a school environment which supports the needs of every student, every day.
